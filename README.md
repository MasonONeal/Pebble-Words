Pebble-Words
============

Winner in the Pebbles Watch category at the 2014 NestGSV + AT&T Wearables Hackathon  

Pebble Words is a flash card application that a user can take anywhere. They can practice customized word lists and can use the buttons orshake-detection features of the watch to progress through a list. The app could be used to study vocabulary or another language.

This app was created for a Pebble Smart Watch as part of a 24-hour hackathon. Pebble watches can pair with a smart phone to gain access to the internet and GPS features of the phone. They can also run stand-alone apps.

The code for the app was written in C. The accompanying website, that allows users to maintain and share word lists, was developed using Ruby, HTML and Sinatra.

You can read about the creation of Pebble Words and see a short video of the app in this blog.
